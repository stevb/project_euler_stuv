# project_euler_stuv
The files located in this folder are some of the Project Euler tasks that I've completed. Some of the early ones are not included because I may not have saved those.
Also using this to get the hang of git, again. I won't necessarily be editing these files on git too much; what I'll be doing is completing them locally and then uploading them for the public or for my own future reference.
